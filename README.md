## UI
The amazing [Kahi UI](https://kahi-ui.nbn.dev/) svelte library was used to provide rapid development.

## Tracking

[Mix Panel](mixpanel.com) is used to track usage in the app - no user data is stored. This is similar to Google Analytics but wanted to try a different service out this time!

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).
